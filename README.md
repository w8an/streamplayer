## AETHER STREAMER - Stream from the Beyond



 **Description**
 
The Aether Streamer is a device to listen to audio streams that are broadcast over the internet. The unit uses WiFi for internet access. The unit will store up to 36 stream channels. 

There is one major control input and that is the knob on the front panel. It can be turned and it can be pressed as a button. Also on the front panel is the display screen. It will light up when settings are made, then go dark after 5 seconds. 

There is also a toggle switch to set the system mode.



**Initial Set Up**

Ensure the toggle switch is in the Norm (normal) position. 
Connect the Aether Streamer to a USB power adapter using the supplied cable. 

*ONLY USE THE SUPPLIED CABLE !*
You may use any Type-A USB power adapter WITH THE SUPPLIED CABLE.
DO NOT USE a generic power pack from another device as it will destroy the AetherStreamer controller chip. 

When first powered up, the AetherStreamer will attempt to connect to the last known WiFi network. If a network is not found, the AetherStreamer will wait for the user to configure a local WiFi access point. The AetherStreamer display will show:

    WIFI PORTAL
    Configure at
    ssid: AetherStreamer
    ip:   192.168.4.1

Use your smartphone, tablet or laptop, and connect its Wifi to the broadcast name: AetherStreamer. There is no password. Once connected, use a browser and go to the address: 192.168.4.1

You should see a configuration web page.

Click the Configure WiFi button. A list of available WiFi connections will be listed at the top of the page. Select a connection name, then enter its password. Click the Save button. The AetherStreamer will connect to the WiFi and is ready for use.



**AetherStreamer Usage**

**Volume Level**

Turn the knob to adjust volume level. Volume range is 0 - 100.

**Change Station**

Press the button then turn the knob to scroll the list to find your desired station. When your desired station is highlighted on the list, press to select. The station stream will be launched immediately upon successful connection. If the connection is not successful, the AetherStreamer will revert to the previous station.

**60 Minute Timer**

The timer is enabled by default after a system start up. It can be disabled.

To disable the timer, set the volume level to zero, then press the button. The display will show: CANCEL TIMER. If the timer is already disabled, the same procedure will enable it. The display will show TIMER SET. Adjust the volume to desired level.

The time remaining until auto-shutdown will display when changing the volume.
When the shutdown time arrives, the unit will go quiet and the display will show: SLEEPING.

To awaken the AetherStreamer, turn the knob and the unit will reconnect to the stream for another 1 hour of play.

**Power Down the AetherStreamer**

Set the volume to zero then press the button 3 times within 3 seconds. The display will show: SYSTEM POWER DOWN. 

**Turn ON the AetherStreamer after Power Down**

Press the button to power up. The display will show: SYSTEM RESTART.

**Modify the Station List**

Set the side panel switch to Portal position.
The display will show the AetherStreamer configuration portal address. It will look
something like:  

    PORTAL OPEN
    192.168.1.10/param 

Using a smartphone, tablet or PC that is on the same WiFi network as the AetherStreamer, open a browser and go to the address displayed on the panel.

There will be 36 memory slots displayed, two lines per item containing the Name and URL Address of each slot. Change any slot Name and the URL as desired. Click the Save button at the bottom of the page to store the changes into the AetherStreamer unit. You should see the display panel on the AetherStreamer unit show:  SAVED.
Set the side panel switch into the center Norm position.
NOTE that if there is an error in the URL entry, the station select list on the AetherStreamer unit will show only the slot number and it cannot be selected for play.


**Force Reset Mode**

The unit can also be placed into a reset hold mode by placing the switch into the Reset position. All AetherStreamer activity is stopped. Set the switch to Norm to start up the unit.


**Force a WiFi Configuration Portal**

If you need to reset the WiFi system name that the AetherStreamer is connected to, set the side panel switch to Reset,  then immediately set it to Portal. The unit will start up into the WiFi configuration mode. Configure the unit as described above under the Initial Set Up instructions.
